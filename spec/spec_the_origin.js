    Creating a new Galaxy
    Pre: The event of creating a galaxy has been determined to exist (probs).
    (TODO: Fix probability termanology)
    1. Pick a dimension. Dimensions need probablity of being picked.
    2. Picj a galactic system.
    3. Roll the galaxy.
    4. Add discoverability to the system - how will "scannars" or "radars" know that a new thing exists that
    can be discovered?
